This mod allows you to craft the Pulverizer and the alloy forge!

The pulverizer does many things it turns cobblestone to gravel, gravel to flint, and flint to sand dust!

New crafting recipes you can now make gunpowder by adding coal and flint to craft gunpowder! And 4 flint can craft gravel, 4 sand dust gets you 1 sand block!

There is now ore duplication through processing! Added gold, copper, and iron dust! Use the pulverizer to break down raw ores into dust! You get two dust per raw ore and 1 dust smelts into 1 ingot!

New block, the alloy forge allows you to create steel armor and tools, it has over double armor durability and the tools are much stronger than iron but weaker than diamond.

This mod also makes diamond armor uncraftable which makes steel armor needed, you can make steel with charcoal or coal no other fuels in the alloy furnace.

All blocks have animations!
