Updated README.md just pasted the description from Modrinth to here. (This mod allows you to craft the pulverizer and the alloy forge!

The pulverizer does many things it turns cobblestone to gravel, gravel to flint, and flint to sand dust! The alloy forge allows you to create steel armor and tools, it has more durability than iron but less than diamond and the tools are much stronger than iron but weaker than diamond! As of 1.1.0 all steel tools, armor, and the single block oxidize! Nuggets and ingots oxidize, and steel blocks can be waxed!

New crafting recipes you can now make gunpowder by adding coal and flint to craft gunpowder! And 4 flint can craft gravel, 4 sand dust gets you 1 sand block! Also too much to put here but the tool recipes and the spears with all the oxidization levels.

There is now ore duplication through processing! Added gold, copper, and iron dust! Use the pulverizer to break down raw ores into dust! You get two dust per raw ore and 1 dust smelts into 1 ingot!

New block, 
ADDED 1.21.11 spears in the newest update 1.1.0 of the mod which includes the modded versions of copper and steel.

This mod also makes diamond armor uncraftable which makes steel armor needed, you can make steel with charcoal or coal no other fuels in the alloy furnace.

Future roadmap! - Now hopefully the mod is good enough I will add a harder way to make certain tools like metal ones to slow the mid and late game a little more difficult. Support for newer versions like 1.21.8-1.21.11. Any suggestions are very much appreciated!

Previous roadmap - I plan on at least adding copper tools and armor that oxidize along with the steel armor and tools which I plan on making rust and also back porting spears that do the same thing!

Previous name was "Pulverizer")
